# Cherp
Cherp lets your friends tell you positive stuff anonymously. Yup, that's it.

## Getting started
```
// Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jacobabrennan/Cherp.git

// Move into project directory, install project with npm
cd Cherp
npm install

// Start the server
node app.js
```

The Cherp server will open on port 8080 by default. You can change this by editing line 2 of app.js

## TO DO
Add https support so I can ask the user for a password, and retrieve submitted cherps.
